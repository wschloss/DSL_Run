<h2>A game where levels are generated by a DSL</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One aspect of game design I've read is that the developers should allow the game to be easily modified by team members who are not programming experts.  I believe it is called "data driven design", and I am currently looking to read more about it.</p>
<p>'Parse and Run' is a simple run/jump game project I'm working on where the levels are all generated from text (which is really a Ruby DSL).  In this way, it is easy to make a new level without having to ever mess around with source code.</p>
<p>Some goals I currently have in mind: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Add to the DSL!</li>
	<li>Expand the amount of game objects</li>
	<li>Fix the horizontal collision detection - sometimes corners are buggy</li>
</ul>
