<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One aspect of game design I've read is that the developers should allow the game to be easily modified by team members who are not programming experts.  I believe it is called "data driven design", and I am currently looking to read more about it.</p>
<p>'Parse and Run' is a simple run/jump game project I'm working on where the levels are all generated from text.  In this way, it is easy to make a new level without having to ever mess around with source code.</p>
<p>Some goals I currently have in mind: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Implement/Improve gameplay</li>
	<li>Write the level generator to understand a small set of instructions</li>
	<li>Expand the amount of game objects and instructions the generator understands</li>
	<li>Allow the generator to read any text and convert it into a level, such as entering your favorite website, and using its content to see what kind of level comes out</li>
</ul>
