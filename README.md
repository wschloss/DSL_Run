<h2>A game where levels are generated by a DSL</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One aspect of game design I've read is that the developers should allow the game to be easily modified by team members who are not programming experts.  A good design reads aspects like level layout from external files that are either easy to create, or that can be generated by a level editing tool made for designers.</p>
<p>'DSL Run' is a simple run/jump game project I'm working on where the levels are all generated from text (which is really a Ruby DSL).  In this way, it is easy to make a new level without having to ever mess around with source code.  The character runs and the spacebar makes him jump</p>
<p>Some goals I currently have in mind: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Add to the DSL!</li>
	<li>Expand the amount of game objects</li>
	<li>Try to remove as much of the actual game definition from the code and place in the DSL.  Maybe one day the DSL will be a sort of platformer game engine language.</li>
	<li>Fix the horizontal collision detection - sometimes corners are buggy</li>
</ul>
